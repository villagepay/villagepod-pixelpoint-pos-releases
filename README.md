# Village Pod WindowsApp

## Instructions for creating a new release
When creating a new release, make sure to tag it with a version number in the format of three digits separated by dots. The name of the release can be anything you want. The release should be marked as the latest version and should include a Setup.exe file, which is the installer for the application.

It's important to note that each new release should have a higher version number than the previous one.

Once installed, the application will automatically check for new releases and download if a new version is available.
